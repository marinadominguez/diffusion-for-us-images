## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for our paper **"Diffusion as Sound Propagation: Physics-inspired Model for Ultrasound Image Generation."** 

Deep learning (DL) methods typically require large datasets to effectively learn data distributions. However, in the medical field, data is often limited in quantity, and acquiring labeled data can be costly. To mitigate this data scarcity, data augmentation techniques are commonly employed. Among these techniques, generative models play a pivotal role in expanding datasets. However, when it comes to ultrasound (US) imaging, the authenticity of generated data often diminishes due to the oversight of ultrasound physics.

We propose a novel approach to improve the quality of generated US images by introducing a physics-based diffusion model that is specifically designed for this image modality. The proposed model incorporates a US-specific scheduler scheme that mimics the natural behavior of sound wave propagation in ultrasound imaging.
